 Don't use LastPass to generate your passwords. Or if you do, do not change any of the defaults.

 Depending on what options are configured, the LastPass password strength meter (inside the browser extensions, or at https://lastpass.com/generatepassword.php) will give completely misleading estimates. For instance, generating a purely numeric 14-digit password results in a green strength bar, although such a password is in fact extremely weak: with just 46 bits of entropy, it would be bruteforced in minutes by even a modest cracking rig. 
 Don't get burned. Use a proper, native password manager.
