While running as a non-admin account is a sound and highly recommended security measure,
it is important to keep in mind that it should only be one layer of your security posture. 

It is very easy to underestimate the amount of damage that can be done by malware running as a standard Windows user.
Here is a quick roundup, which could hopefully serve as a refresher:

  1.   keylogging / password stealing 
  2.   file encryption (e.g., Cryptowall)
  3.   recording audio/video
  4.   banking trojan infections (e.g., Dridex) 
  5.   persistence (surviving reboots)
  6.   formatting external FAT drives  
  7.   infecting USB sticks 
  8.   sending out any data  (outbound FW rules typically won't help much)
  9.   browser hijacking 
  10.  joining botnets
  11.  hosting illegal and/or darknet content  
  12.  serving a remote console (e.g., VNC)

In case I missed any other major risks, comments are welcome!
