title: MZuck32 - A PE/HTML Hybrid File
comments: true
---

In the binary oddity department, here's a funny little corkami-style beast: Mzuck32 is a tiny (3634-byte) file that 
can be opened both as a valid Windows executable and a viewable web page (with an image embedded) just by switching its extension between EXE or HTM(L). :-)   


Features:

  - Valid Win x86 PE
  - Viewable HTML+SVG page
  - Tribute to Facebook (what?) :) 
  - For extra geekiness, MD5 hash is digits-only ;)

     Size (bytes, unzipped): 3634
     MD5: 11154659197220219689725940689118
     
     (Tested on Windows 8.1 / 32 bits - but it should work on other versions too)
     
Coming up next: A web page / C64 executable hybrid ;)
