Here's a fun little beast for binary polyglot fans: Mzuck32 is a tiny 3634-byte file that can be opened both as a valid Windows executable and a viewable HTML file (with an image embedded) just by renaming its extension. :-)   

     Facebook theme :) 
     Tested on Windows 8.1 
     For extra geekiness MD5 hash is digits-only ;)
