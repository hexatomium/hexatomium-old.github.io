 Don't use LastPass to generate your passwords. Or if you do, do not change any of the settings.

 Depending on what options are configured, the LastPass password strength meter (inside the browser extensions, or at https://lastpass.com/generatepassword.php) 
 can give completely misleading estimates. For instance, generating a purely numeric 14-digit password results in a green strength bar, although such a password 
 in fact extremely weak: with just 46 bits of entropy - it would be bruteforced in minutes by even a modest password cracking rig. 
 Don't get burned!
