  I've always been fascinated both by palindromes and tiny executabless, so here we go...


  This tiny (600-byte) Windows executable will run identically even if all bytes are reversed!

  What's so special about this?
  It's a new type of palindrome, an executable palindrome.

  The palindrome part is technically simple. The only twist i made to make it a little more 
  interesting is that it runs the code from the mirrored section. :) 
  
  Most existing EXEs can easily be turned made into palindromes 
   (notable exceptions: digitally signed ones)

  Does it run on every win version? yes it does.
