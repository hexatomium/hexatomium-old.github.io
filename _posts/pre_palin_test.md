  I've always been fascinated by palindromes, so here we go...

  This 624-byte Windows executable will run identically even if all bytes are reversed!
  The executable should valid on all Windows versions.


  start in style
  so that's what happens when i drink too much for new year's...

  does it run on every win version? yes it does.
  did it take any skills to put this together? 
  the only skill required is the superior ability to 
  procrastinate like a turkish monk. just being seriously 
  bored was enough and  as long as it helps get the girls ;)
  
  
  what's so special about this?
  it's a new type of palindrome, an EXE palindrome.
  if reversed, it still executes! 
  technically not complex, the only twist i made is that it run 
  the code in the mirrored section! just to make it more fun ;)
  most exes can easily be turned made into palindromes 
   (notable exceptions: digitally signed ones)
