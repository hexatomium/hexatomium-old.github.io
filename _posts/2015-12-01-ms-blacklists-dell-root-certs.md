Unless you've spent the last few days in a cave, you have probably heard of Dell's <A href=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/23/dude_youre_getting_pwned/>user-pwning root certificate saga</a>. 
Meanwhile Dell responded by releasing an <a href=http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/direct2dell/b/direct2dell/archive/2015/11/23/response-to-concerns-regarding-edellroot-certificate>emergency fix</a>, and Microsoft just joined the damage-control effort by pushing a global CTL update to blacklist the 2 sinful certificates.  That's a very good thing, especially as reports of malware samples signed with those certs are beginning to surface.

If you are running any supported version of Windows, you should receive the update within 24 hours.
